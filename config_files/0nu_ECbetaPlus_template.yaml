# Specification of the process. The format is a dict of the form:
# {"name": name, "option1": value1, ...}
# For 2nu modes the option is "transition". Possible values:
#   0->0: transition from gs (0+) to gs (0+)
#   0->2: transition from gs (0+) to first excited 2+ state.
# For 0nu modes the option "mechanism" can be used. Possible values:
#   "LNE": light neutrino exchange
